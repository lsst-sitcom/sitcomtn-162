# Testing the implementation of Metadetection and Cell-Based Coadds on Abell 360 ComCam data

```{abstract}
The purpose of this technote is to test the technical quality of ComCam commissioning data, specifically the Rubin_SV_38_7 field, by utilizing cell-based coadds and Metadetection by measuring the tangential shear profile, and the cross shear profile, of the massive cluster Abell 360 (called A360 throughout the technote). The process entails generating the cell-based coadds for Metadetection to run on, identifying and removing cluster member galaxies, applying quality cuts, and calibrating the shear measurements. Once a shear profile is generated, validation is the bulk of the remaining analysis.

Cell-based coadds and Metadetection are both currently in the process of being implemented within the LSST Science Pipelines at the time of this technote. There is quite a bit of technical value in attempting a difficult measurement prior to full implementation. Measuring the tangential shear around A360 will showcase the current abilities of these algorithms, as well as highlight where work is still needed.
